# Where this first appeared

All leaks started with this image:<br><br>

By the way, its an image from gta5\scripts\ folder. Everybody thinked that is the source code but no its just the scripts folder.<br>
The real source code root looks like this:<br>

# My Building Experience

When i first see this type of shit on Telegram, i ignored it because i dont thinked that this was not easy. But after some time i tried to compile the game but i failed because when it first leaked, there was no tutorial about compiling the game.

But after some time i've seen a video about the leaked source code, and that guy was posted a tutorial, i ignored again but after the time has come, i readed the tutorial that made in rentry.co, a pastebin-copy site.

I created a virtual virtual machine and installed every dependencies, Virtual Machine crashed 5+ times, after some getting some hysterics, i finally compiled the game and ready to open. I opened the game and it gave me unknown symbol error...

AND I GOT ANOTHER HYSTERICS! but after i realized it was the rpf encrypt problem, i dragged modified update.rpf and update2.rpf to the ArchiveFix.exe and the game worked.

I put all the game files to my Real PC and tested it

I played the game for like 1 hours and it was really good and okay.

I didn't compiled the game on Debug, i compiled this game in BankRelease because i need performance. The game runs like real GTA5(because its real XD)

It was not easy but atleast its a good thing, but it was easier than compiling CS:GO Source Code.

# Epilogue

Okay thats all im gonna say, just goodbye then.<br>
It's been 2 month since i published a blog, Sorry about that :P
