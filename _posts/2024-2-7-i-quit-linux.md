Hello, welcome to another post or blog or whatever,
This time i will just talk about why i did i delete linux mint from my system.


I did that because i just bored at linux and i missed Windows so much then i switched to Windows again.

But another reason is that, when i tried to install windows 10, a error appeared about boot.

When i removed the linux, linux partitions and boot files and when i tryed to install windows 10, the error is gone!

I don't wanted to delete linux but i was really confused about that and removed the whole linux from my computer.


I will get back onto linux sometime but not right now and not as a Main OS.

Can you guys just tell me what Linux Distro is better? if you do just add a issue about that to here:
